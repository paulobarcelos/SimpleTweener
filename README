SimpleTweener
-------------
C++ tweening engine (works well with OpenFrameworks and cinder).
- Works with all Robber Penner easing equations. (included)
- You can use repeat modes like LOOP and BACK_AND_FORTH.
- You can add several teens to the same variable and they won't overwrite each other, allowing you to "layer" tweens.
